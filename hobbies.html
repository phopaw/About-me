    <h4>Going to the Gym</h4>
    <p class=".fs-6 text">I like going to the gym in my free time, as it allows me to engage in physical activity and improve my overall health and well-being. I find weightlifting to be particularly therapeutic both mentally and physically, as it allows me to release any stress or tension I may be feeling. I started weightlifting in November 2021, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Since then, I've been consistently working out both inside and outside of school, focusing on building my strength and improving my form. The gym has become a central part of my routine, and I always look forward to my next workout.</p>

    <h4>Piano</h4>
    <p class=".fs-6 text">In addition to weightlifting, I also enjoy playing my piano in my free time. I started playing in September 2022, and although I'm still a beginner, I find it to be a rewarding and challenging hobby. I love the feeling of getting lost in the music and the sense of accomplishment that comes with mastering a new song. However, I know that I need to spend more time practicing if I want to improve. I've set a goal for myself to practice at least an hour every day, and I'm excited to see how my skills will progress over time. Overall, playing the piano is a creative outlet for me that allows me to express myself in a unique and meaningful way.</p>

    <h4>Crocheting</h4>
    <p class=".fs-6 text">Although I haven't been crocheting for very long, I find it to be a relaxing and enjoyable hobby. I've collected bundles of yarn in different colors and textures, and I've been experimenting with different patterns and stitches. One of my favorite things to crochet are flowers, particularly lavender flowers. I find it satisfying to see my progress as I create something beautiful and useful from just a ball of yarn. Crocheting has become a way for me to keep my mind off things and to de-stress. It's a great way to unwind after a long day, and I love how portable it is, so I can take it with me wherever I go and work on it in my spare time. Even though I'm still a beginner.</p>
