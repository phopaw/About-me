<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Tho Du Paw. The significance of my name lies in its meaning. "Tho Du" means "strong soldier" in the Karen language, and my parents chose this name for me because my dad used to work with the army in Thailand. "Paw" means "flower" in the Karen language and is common in many female names. I was born in a Mae La refugee camp and I'm Karen. The Karen people are an ethnic minority group in Myanmar and Thailand, and their culture is deeply rooted in nature. I embrace my name and continue to appreciate its significance to the beauty of the Karen culture. My name is significant to me because it is unique. To me, it strength and symbolizes independence as a women.
</p>
<p>  I was born in Thailand and moved to the United States when I was 1 year old. Unfortunately, I don't have any memories of Thailand and sometimes wish that I did. When I was 6 years old, my parents got divorced and I moved from Pennsylvania to Nebraska with my aunt. Adjusting to a new environment was challenging, especially since my mom was working a lot and I didn't get to see her as much as I would have liked. Elementary and middle school hasn't been easy for me. However, things have improved now that I'm in high school and more independent. I wanted to take this opportunity to share a bit about myself and my interests with you on this website.
